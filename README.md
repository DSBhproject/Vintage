## 🧰 Usage

Drop **Vintage** into PlugData and use it as a texture plugin within your DAW.  
Each parameter simulates a unique artifact from vinyl playback: Crackles and Pops create transient accents, Hiss and Hum add a noise floor, and the Drive knob introduces mild harmonic saturation.

The **RIAA Curve** gradually shapes the EQ response to replicate vinyl coloration — from subtle rounding to full analog tilt.

Ideal for lo-fi beats, ambient layers, retro synths, or warming up sterile mixes.
